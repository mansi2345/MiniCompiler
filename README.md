  Mini Compiler for a Simple Custom Language
This is a compiler written for a simple custom language that supports basic features like variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and conditionals (if, else, while, repeat, etc.). Function support is intentionally excluded to keep the language minimal.

A full-stack interface is provided:

✅ Frontend: React-based editor and terminal-style output

✅ Backend: Node.js (Express) server with WebSocket support for real-time I/O

✅ Core Compiler: Built using Flex (lexer), Bison (parser), and C++ for AST, semantic analysis, and LLVM IR generation
